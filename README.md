# fizzbuzz

A collection of fizzbuzz programs in different programming languages. Fizz buzz is a children's game in which players take turns counting. If a number is divisible by three, the player must say "fizz" instead of the number. If a number is divisible by five, the player must say "buzz". And if a number is divisible by both three and five, the player must say "fizz buzz". In addition to being a child's game, fizz buzz is also commonly used as programming challenge in job interviews to determine if the interviewee at least knows the basics of programming.

My goal is for each program to be (in descending order of priority):

	1. Correct
	2. Safe
	3. Readable 
	4. Idiomatic 

I welcome improvements to any of the programs, especially those that help me achieve the above goals. However, I am not inclined to make changes that further a lesser goal at the expense of a higher goal.
